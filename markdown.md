#Markdown File
After taking the time to use Github, read about its features, and become familiar with the tool, I have learned many cool things about the platform. The following is a list of things i have learned:
 - Repositories are where you store the contents of a project.
 - When there are multiple people working on a project, GitHub has things called "pull requests" where someone can have their edits be reviewed and approved.
 - "Branches" are areas where you can work on code that isn't ready to be merged to the main repo just yet.
 - An "issue" is used to describe changes you plan to make or raise awareness of something that needs to be fixed.
